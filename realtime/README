Step 0: SSH agent
- Launch an ssh agent for passwordless authentication with EC2 hosts.

Step 1: Launch instances
- Launch Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit) instances in EC2 in one or more geographical regions.
- Use the default security group.

Step 2: Prepare security group
- Manually edit the default security group, adding an inbound rule that allows unrestricted traffic from the same group.
- Remove all other inbound rules that may have been added by the scripts in prior runs.

Step 3: Obtain list of host IPs
- Configure the AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY environment variables.
- Ensure that the aws command line tools are installed.
- Enter the name(s) of the region(s) in scripts/regions, one region per line.  Do not include the availability zone (e.g., "us-west-2" is correct, "uw-west-2a" is incorrect).
- cd ConAnalysis/EC2
- ./configure_ips.sh
- Inspect ../scripts/servers_ec2 and ../scripts/servers_ec2_public_private to ensure that the files contain the correct number of entries, with one EC2 host per line.
- NOTE: Do not run the tool (see last step) on the same host as one of the storage servers.
        After completing this step, remove the IP of the host that runs the tool from servers_ec2 and servers_ec2_public_private.

Step 4: Storage system setup
- Run the scripts/setup_ubuntu_cluster.sh script.
- Alternatively, at each host clone the git repository and then execute scripts/setup_ubuntu.sh to download and install Cassandra.
- Most of the installation is non-interactive, but be prepared to accept the Oracle Java license agreement at each host.
- Double-check that Cassandra got installed.  Update the CVER variable in setup_ubuntu.sh if you get an HTTP 404 response while trying to download Cassandra.

Step 5: Configure tool
- Edit settings.sh under the scripts subdirectory.  (Do not confuse this with settings.py, which is deprecated.)
- Use default settings whenever possible.

Step 6: Launch tool
- From the scripts subdirectory execute ./run_watca.sh
- By default, the web interface binds to port 12346.
